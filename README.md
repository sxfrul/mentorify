# Mentorify (UTM AI Hackathon)

### Submitted Description:
`As I was growing up, I watched a movie called 'Stars on Earth' where a little boy named ‘Ishaan’ was ridiculed for his incompetence in learning. But what they failed to realize was that he had 'dyslexia'. We from, “Mentorify”, are proposing an idea to become the helping hand for the millions of Ishaans’ around the world. Our project aims to provide a unique learning experience for all students with different learning capabilities (ie. auditory). Our plan is to produce a platform that utilizes AI to generate personalized study materials depending on the user’s needs.`
